# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The `main` branch is the supported development line. Tagged releases will receive security fixes when maintainers have capacity to ship them.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not open a public issue for a suspected vulnerability.

Use [GitHub private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/GipsyChef/github-monitor/security/advisories/new) if it is enabled for this repository. If that is unavailable, contact the maintainers privately at [cigan1@gmail.com](mailto:cigan1@gmail.com).

Include:

- affected version or commit;
- steps to reproduce;
- expected impact;
- whether a GitHub token, repository write access, or local network access is required.

## Security Model

GitHub Monitor is intended to run on a trusted local machine and binds to `127.0.0.1` by default. It authenticates to GitHub with either a personal access token (PAT) read from `GITHUB_TOKEN` / `GH_TOKEN` / `gh auth token`, or with installation tokens minted from a GitHub App you control. Both paths are used for API reads and dashboard-initiated merge/close actions. Automatic Dependabot PR closure and workflow cancellation is disabled by default and runs in the background only when `DEPENDABOT_QUEUE_THRESHOLD` is set to a positive integer; `DEPENDABOT_QUEUE_OWNERS` can restrict its owner scope. Treat the local dashboard as privileged whenever the active credential has write access.

Do not expose the server directly to an untrusted network.

## GitHub App private keys

When the GitHub App auth mode is enabled (`GITHUB_APP_ID` and `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH` both set):

- Store the `.pem` private key outside this repository. The recommended location is `~/.config/github-monitor/github-app-private-key.pem`.
- Set the file mode to `0600`. The server warns at startup if the key is readable by group or others.
- Do not paste private key contents into shell environment variables; use the file path mechanism. PEM bodies have literal newlines that are easy to leak through shell history, process listings, and CI logs.
- The repository `.gitignore` excludes `*.pem` files. Do not move the key into the working tree even temporarily.
- Rotate the key on a schedule and immediately if you suspect exposure. Setup and rotation steps are documented in [docs/github-app-setup.md](docs/github-app-setup.md). Audit usage in the App's settings and your repositories' security log when investigating a suspected leak.
